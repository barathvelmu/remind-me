# Reminder Application ðŸ“†
## Introduction
Hello! Thanks for visiting this project! 

*Project was built using JavaScript, CSS, JSX, React, JSON Server.*

The purpose of this Reminder Application was to learn React and get familiar with React Hooks. I adopted a component-focused design pattern (breaking application 
into components) to truly grasp the power of React. This was my first experience with "thinking in components". This project has been deployed [here](https://barathvelmu.github.io/remind-me/). 

As this project utilized a "mock" backend with "JSON server", the application is not readily usable through the deployed link. I worked with ["JSON server"](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/create-a-rest-api-with-json-server-36da8680136d) to get a taste of full-stack development using React (e.g., HTTP methods etc.). Please refer to the next section(s) on how to use the application. Thank you. 

## What is the goal of this project?
As aforementioned, this project was my first time working with React and JavaScript (JS) at this scale. I put my learning of JS into practice and picked up React together. This project is also a stepping stone for future JS/React projects that I will create. It gave me a look into the workflow/architecture of React.

## How to use the application? 
### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

For the next step, it would be best to have two terminals open. One running the development server. One running the JSON server. On one, 

### Run React Development Server (http://localhost:3000)

```
npm start
```

and on the other, 

### Run the JSON server (http://localhost:5000)

```
npm run server
```
